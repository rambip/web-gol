## Yet another game of life project

This repository is a project demonstrating what you can do with wasm-bindgen to make a fast dynamic webpage using webassembly.

You can build it with `build.sh`. The site will run locally, just type 'http://localhost:8000/' in your browser to test it.

- Prerequisites:
- - [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) with cargo, the rust compiler and package manager
- - Python 3 with the `http.server` module. Try `pip install http.server` if you don't have it.
